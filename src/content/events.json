has over 25 years of experience in the event industry. In 1996, he and his business partner Chad Kropke founded FNTECH in a small shop in Huntington Beach, CA. Bob Moe soon joined them and together they grew FNTECH into a full-service production company with multiple locations, over 100 fulltime employees and millions in revenue. Jeremy began his career in production as an audio engineer and quickly moved up the ladder to technical director, project manager, and finally executive producer. Having a deep well of experience executing high-profile, multi-million dollar events all over the world, some with more than 120,000 in attendance, we can safely say that there’s a blue moon in the
