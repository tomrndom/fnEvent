YOU DECIDE!

In the FNvirtual platform, the top navigation is up to you! The “About this event” section could be a great way to share the story behind your meeting. How did it come to be? What were the driving forces or key turning points? Maybe include a timeline, or some big highlights that happened throughout the years. Would you rather use this real estate for something else? No problem! Just name the tab something else and point it in a totally different direction!

The YOCO Summit was created to showcase our new FNvirtual event platform. YOCO—short for “Your Company”—was dreamed up by our creative team, allowing us to play with a faux brand in the full environment. YOCO has its own guidelines, voice, and visual identity. Pretty spiffy for a company that doesn’t exist, eh?

[Check out our branding guidelines!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w7qiav79lnnl93r/__FNvirtual-YOCO-site-guidelines.pdf?dl=0)

By the way, did you notice the “sponsor” and brand partner ads peppered throughout the site? Some are real companies that we know and love; others are faux brands we created so as to not step on another company’s branded toes. We think it works pretty well. How about you?
