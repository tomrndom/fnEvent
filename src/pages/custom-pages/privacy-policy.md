FNTECH’s Product and Marketing Pages

FNTECH generally processes personal data in two different manners when using its platform. First, FNTECH processes personal data it obtains from the webpages interfaces that FNTECH uses to provide its Services, such as the landing page a user sees after clicking on a link to join a conference (FNTECH’s “Event Pages”). Event Pages also include webpages and links that are only accessible to a FNTECH account holder after they login to their FNTECH account. Event Pages serve only third-party cookies that are necessary for technical support and to deliver the service. There are no interest-based advertising cookies on Event Pages.

Second, FNTECH processes personal data obtained from its webpages that are accessible without logging in to a FNTECH account (FNTECH’s “Marketing Pages”). Marketing Pages, such as www.FNTECH.us, are designed to encourage sales of FNTECH Services. They tell you about our product, plans, and pricing, features, and other related information.
